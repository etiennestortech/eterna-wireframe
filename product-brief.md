## Founder

**Pierre Béliveau** — As a boy, Pierre lost a childhood friend to drowning. At the funeral, he was struck by the thought that burial also meant contact with rising groundwater. That memory stayed with him for life and became a mission: to find another way to honor the departed. After years of research, he created the Capsule Pyrale. More than a technical product — it's a tribute rooted in dignity and peace.

## Product

**Name:** Capsule Pyrale
**Category:** Funeral capsule / hermetic preservation container
**NOT a casket** — an alternative to both traditional burial and cremation

### Core Description
An innovative hermetic funeral container made of recyclable aluminum. The body is placed inside, the capsule is sealed with inert gas (nitrogen), which naturally dries the body — preventing decomposition without any chemicals, embalming fluids, or odors. Estimated preservation: **60 to 100 years**.

## How It Works (3 Steps)

**Step 1 — Gentle Placement**
The body is placed inside by qualified professionals using a discreet, secure system. Every gesture is slow, deliberate, respectful. No rushed movements.

**Step 2 — Hermetic Sealing**
The cover is lowered and locked with a special sealing key. The mechanism creates a completely airtight barrier — no leaks, no odors, no infiltration possible.

**Step 3 — Inert Gas Preservation**
The capsule is filled with inert nitrogen gas. This naturally dries the body, slowing decomposition without chemicals or toxic release. The body can be preserved for up to 100 years.

# Wireframe Adaptation Analysis

## What the wireframe currently assumes (incorrectly)

The wireframe was built around a **fictional casket company** ("Eterna") selling handcrafted wooden caskets. The real product is fundamentally different. Here's what needs to change:

---

## Page-by-Page Adaptation Notes

### index.html (Homepage)
| Current | Should be |
|---|---|
| "Canada's Finest Handcrafted Caskets" | "A New Way to Say Goodbye" / "Eternity Begins Here" |
| Wood casket hero image | Capsule Pyrale product image (aluminum capsule) |
| Trust bar: "Canadian Craft / Transparent Pricing / Direct Delivery / Your Legal Right" | "100% Québec / No Chemicals / 60–100 Year Preservation / Patented Technology" |
| Brand story about bypassing funeral home markup | Founder story: Pierre Béliveau's childhood promise |
| Product configurator (wood/finish/hardware) | Product overview (color/LED/engraving) + how it works |
| "The Makers" (woodworkers) | → Remove or replace with certifications/research timeline |
| Consumer Rights by Province section | → Remove (not relevant — no conflict with funeral homes on this product) |
| Testimonials (fictional) | → Keep structure, fill with real partners + real quotes when available |

### product.html
| Current | Should be |
|---|---|
| Casket product page with wood/finish/hardware | Capsule Pyrale product page |
| Pricing: $16,000 | No public price — "Request a Quote" |
| Material specs: hardwood, joinery | Aluminum, polycarbonate, ABS, hydraulic mechanism |
| Configurator | Color (Black/White) + LED + engraving |
| Sustainability = FSC-certified lumber | Sustainability = 100% recyclable aluminum + no chemicals |

### about.html
| Current | Should be |
|---|---|
| Company origin story about funeral markup | Pierre Béliveau's childhood story → 2011 first test → 2014 results |
| "Master woodworkers" team | Founder bio + R&D timeline |
| Company values (craft-focused) | Real values: Innovation, Respect, Transparency, Sustainability, Kindness, Cultural Openness |

### find-partner.html
- **Keep the structure** — B2B partner network is very relevant
- Change stats: real partner count, real provinces
- Change partner cards: use the 2 real named partners (Le Sieur, Saguenay)
- Change B2B pitch: focus on "no inventory investment" angle (rental model), viewable bodies, modern families

### become-partner.html
- Keep structure, update copy to reflect rental vs. purchase model
- Highlight: compatible with crypts/mausoleums, remote regions, international transport

### know-your-rights.html
- **Remove entirely or repurpose** — the "consumer rights / funeral homes must accept third-party caskets" angle does not apply to this product
- Could repurpose as an educational page: "What is the Capsule Pyrale?" FAQ or a "Grief Resources" page

### pre-planning.html
- Keep structure — pre-planning is relevant
- Change angle: not about locking in price, but about giving family peace of mind and extended time to grieve
- Emphasize: "preserve the bond a little longer"

### blog.html / blog-article.html
- Keep structure
- Update article titles/topics to match real product concerns: decomposition, eco-burials, grief, modern farewell practices

### contact.html
- Update with real contact info: 411 Saint-Vallier, Granby QC · 1 844 695-5613 · info@pyramidestal.com
- Keep form structure, update subject line options to match real inquiry types

### lead-gen.html / funnel pages
- The configurator funnel needs a full rethink:
  - Step 1: Are you planning ahead (pre-need) or in immediate need?
  - Step 2: Select color (Black/White) + LED preference + engraving
  - Step 3: Quote request (no live pricing)
  - The current "checkout" model doesn't apply — it's a quote/consultation flow

---

## Summary of Biggest Changes Required

1. **Product category shift:** Wooden casket → Aluminum hermetic capsule. Every product reference needs updating.
2. **No public pricing:** Remove the $16,000 price point everywhere. Replace with "Request a Quote."
3. **Value proposition pivot:** From "bypass funeral home markup" → "preserve the body & extend the farewell, without chemicals."
4. **Founder story:** Replace fictional brand history with Pierre Béliveau's real story.
5. **Remove consumer rights section:** Not applicable to this product.
6. **Remove "The Makers" woodworker profiles:** Replace with R&D timeline / patent / certifications.
7. **Real contact info:** Replace fictional Eterna details with real Pyramidestal details.
8. **Funnel rethink:** No e-commerce checkout — it's a quote request flow.
9. **B2B partner angle:** Stronger emphasis on funeral home partnership (rental + purchase model).
10. **Bilingual consideration:** The real site is FR/EN/ES — the wireframe is English only. Flag for client.
